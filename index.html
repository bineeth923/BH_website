            A lot of people seem like they have a good personality until you see them in an emergency or tense situation.
            Then they lose their cool. Don’t be this person! If you are in a tense situation, try to remain relaxed and see
            what you can do to resolve the situation.For example, lets say your car breaks down on the highway
            and you’re going to be late to work.Don’t start yelling and screaming – that’s not going to fix anything.
            Keep your mind clear and start developing a plan to solve the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            One part about having a good personality is being willing to change your worldview.
            Listen to others and always be willing to change your mind. Don’t pass judgment on other people
            just because they act in a different way than you do. Keeping an open mind will allow you to make
            many new friends and probably live a much more interesting life. There’s no need to shut off parts of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t try to act like you know everything, but always try to offer a helping hand to people when possible.
            This could be something as simple as helping a friend move out of their house or more involved support like
            life guidance. Offer whatever insight you may have but don’t try to sway them too far in one direction. Respect
            people’s decisions and opinions.

            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
